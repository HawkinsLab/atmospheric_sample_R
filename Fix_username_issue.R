#Configure Git with global commands. 
#I have found this step necessary both times I ran through this process. 
#Open up the bash version of Git and type the following:         
#git config -–global user.name “your GitHub account name”                             
#git config –global user.email “GitHubEmail@something.com”
#Open Rstudio and set the path to Git executable. 
#Go to Tools > Options > Git/SVN 
#It is important that you find your git.exe file (as shown above). 
#This may be located in any number of places 
#depending on your operating system, 
#but the location of your GIT install is a good first place to look.
